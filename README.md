# ixml-syntax-highlighting

This extension adds support to VSCode for the [iXML](https://invisiblexml.org/) (invisible XML) grammar specification language.  
It has been tested against both the Oberon sample found on John Lumley's [jwiXML](https://johnlumley.github.io/jwiXML.xhtml) test tool and the official [spec](https://invisiblexml.org/1.0/#complete).

## Features

Basic support for iXML, should work well enough with most themes.

## Release Notes


Release notes may be found in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Contributing

Help is welcome as either pull requests or issues.  
LSP support is out of scope unless somebody else writes an iXML language server.
